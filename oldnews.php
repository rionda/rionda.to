			student), <a href="http://www.epasto.org">Alessandro Epasto</a>, and
			<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/eli/">Eli Upfal</a>).</li>
			<li><strong>arXiv:</strong> a much longer version of <a
			href="papers/DeStefaniEtAl-TRIEST-TKDD.pdf">TRI&Egrave;ST</a> is now
			available.</li>
			<li><strong>ACM WSDM'17:</strong> I joined the Program Committee of
			<a href="http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2017/">WSDM'17</a>, a conference
			I always enjoy so much.</li>
			<li><strong>IEEE ICDM'16:</strong> I joined the Program Committee of
			<a href="http://icdm16.eurecat.org">ICDM'16</a>, which takes place in
			the most awesome city of Barcelona.</li>
			<li><strong>ACM KDD'16:</strong> Two papers of mine (<a
			href="papers/RiondatoUpfal-BetweennessRademacherAverages-TKDD.pdf">ABRA</a>
			and <a href="papers/DeStefaniEtAl-TRIEST-TKDD.pdf">TRI&Egrave;ST</a>)
			were accepted as full presentations. See you in SF in August!</li>
			<li><strong>ACM CIKM'16:</strong> I joined the Program Committee of
				<a href="http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/">ACM CIKM'16</a>. Nice event
				that brings together different communities.</li>
				<li><strong>ECML PKDD'16:</strong> I am a member of the Program
				Committee. This year the conference will be in beautiful Riva del
				Garda, on Lake Garda, Italy, very close to my hometown Padua!</li>
			<li><strong>SINS'16:</strong> I'm giving a talk on <a
				href="/papers/RiondatoUpfal-BetweennessRademacherAverages-TKDD.pdf">ABRA</a>
				at <a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~sins2016/">SINS'16</a>, a workshop
				on Social Impact through Network Science. It takes place in Venice, in
				June. Looking forward to meeting many people there!</li>
			<li><strong>GHC'16:</strong> I'm so very excited to be part of the PC
				for the <a
				href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/2014-call-for-participation/technology-zone/#data-science">Data
				Science track at Grace Hopper 2016</a>, the celebration of women in
				computing.</li>
			<li><strong>arXiv:</strong> Two new works on the arXiv, one on <a
				href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07424">approximate counting
				triangles from streams</a> (joint work with <a
				href="http://www.epasto.org">Alessandro Epasto</a>, Lorenzo De Stefani,
				and <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/eli/">Eli Upfal</a>), and
				one on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05866">fully-dynamic
				betweenness centrality approximation</a> (joint work with <a
				href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/eli/">Eli Upfal</a>). Sampling
				rules everything around me, and these two papers show it.</li>
			<li><strong>DAMI/DMKD:</strong> Our paper <a
				href="papers/RiondatoEtAl-GraphSummarization-DMKD.pdf"><em>Graph
				Summarization with Quality Guarantees</em></a> (joint work with David
				Garc&iacute;a-Soriano and Francesco Bonchi) was accepted for
				publication. Geometric clustering and extremal graph theory get
				together, and the chemistry is great!</li>
			<li><strong>WWW'16:</strong> We are giving our tutorial <a
				href="centrtutorial/"><em>Centrality Measures on
				Big Graphs: Exact, Approximated, and Distributed
				Algorithms</em></a> (joint work with <a
				href="http://www.francescobonchi.com">Francesco Bonchi</a> and <a
				href="http://www.gdfm.me">Gianmarco De Francisci Morales</a>). I
				am also a member of the PC and will chair the <a
				href="https://www2016.ca/program/program-by-track/research-track.html#track-1-r-520be-social-networks-graph-analysis-1">Social
				Networks and Graph Analysis 1</a> session. See you in Montreal!</li>
			<li><strong>ACM KDD'16:</strong> I'm a PC member for the Research
				track. After WSDM'16, another trip to San Francisco to hear about
				exciting research.</li>
			<li><strong>ACM WSDM'16:</strong> Our paper <em>Wiggins: Detecting
				Valuable Information in Dynamic Networks with Limited Resources</em>
				(joint work with Eli Upfal and Ahmad Mahmoody) was accepted.</li>
			<li><strong>Brown University:</strong> In Spring 2016, I am teaching <a
						href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1951-g.html">Optimization
						Methods in Finance</a>, in the <a
						href="http://cs.brown.edu/">Department of Computer
						Science</a>. A wonderful area of computer science, with relevant
						applications. As usual, I will be balancing theory and
						practice.</li>
			<li><strong>Stevens Institute of Technology:</strong> on Thursday 12/10 I
				will give a guest lecture on Data Mining, hosted by <a
				href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~gvalk/">George Valkanas</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Monash University:</strong> On Wednesday 10/28 I'm giving
				a talk: <em>Travel pictures from another world: Statistical Learning
				Theory meets Data Mining</em>.</li>
			<li><strong>CIKM'15:</strong> On Friday 10/23, I'm presenting a <a
