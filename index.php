				<p>I am a researcher in computer science, currently working in the
				Labs group at <a href="http://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>, a highly
				innovative investment firm in New York City.</p>
				<p>My research interest is in algorithmic data analysis. I develop
				theory and methods to extract the most information from large datasets,
				as fast as possible and in a statistically sound way. The problems I
				study include pattern extraction, graph mining, and time series
				analysis. My algorithms often use concepts from statistical learning
				theory and sampling.</p>
				<p>My Erd&#337;s number is 3 (Erd&#337;s &rarr; Suen &rarr; Upfal
				&rarr; Matteo), and I am a <a

				descendant</a> of Eli Upfal, Eli Shamir (2nd generation), Jacques
				Hadamard (5th), Simeon Denis Poisson (9th generation) and Pierre-Simon
				Laplace (10th).</p>
