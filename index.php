					<p>I am an <strong>assistant professor</strong> of <a
					href="https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/computer_science">computer
					science</a> at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu">Amherst
					College</a>. I also have an appointment as visiting faculty in <a
					href="https://cs.brown.edu">Computer Science at Brown
					University</a>. Previously, I spent some fantastic years as a
					research scientist in the Labs group at <a
					href="https://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>.</p>
					<p>My research focuses on <strong>algorithms</strong> for
					<strong>knowledge discovery</strong>, <strong>data mining</strong>,
					and <strong>machine learning</strong>. I develop theory and methods
					to extract the most information from large datasets, as fast as
					possible and in a statistically sound way. The problems I study
					include pattern extraction, graph mining, and time series analysis.
					My algorithms often use concepts from statistical learning theory and
					sampling.</p>
