				<p>I am a researcher in computer science, currently working in the
				Labs group at <a href="http://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>, an highly
				innovative investment firm in New York City.</p>
				<p>My research interest is in algorithmic data analysis. I develop
				algorithms to extract the most information from data, as fast as
				possible and in a statistically sound way. The problems I study
				include pattern extraction, graph mining, and time series analysis. My
				results often involve the use of statistical learning theory and
				sampling.</p>
