				<p>I am a researcher in computer science, currently with the
				Labs group at <a href="https://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>, a
				highly innovative investment firm in New York City. I also have an
				appointment as Adjunct Assistant Professor of
				<a href="https://cs.brown.edu">Computer Science at Brown
				University</a>.</p>
				<p>In January 2019 I will be joining the <a
				href="https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/computer_science">computer
				science department</a> at <a href="http://www.amherst.edu">Amherst
				College</a> as an assistant professor.</p>
				<p>My research interest is in <em>algorithmic data science</em>. I
				develop theory and methods to extract the most information from large
				datasets, as fast as possible and in a statistically sound way. The
				problems I study include pattern extraction, graph mining, and time
				series analysis. My algorithms often use concepts from statistical
				learning theory and sampling.</p>
