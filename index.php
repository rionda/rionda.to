				<p>I am a researcher in computer science, currently with the
				Labs group at <a href="http://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>, a highly
				innovative investment firm in New York City. I also have an appointment
				as Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown
				University.</p>
				<p>My research interest is in <em>algorithmic data science</em>. I
develop
				theory and methods to extract the most information from large datasets,
				as fast as possible and in a statistically sound way. The problems I
				study include pattern extraction, graph mining, and time series
				analysis. My algorithms often use concepts from statistical learning
				theory and sampling.</p>
				<p>My Erd&#337;s number is 3 (Erd&#337;s &rarr; Suen &rarr; Upfal
				&rarr; Matteo), and I am a <a

				descendant</a> of <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/eli/">Eli
				Upfal</a>, Eli Shamir (2<sup>nd</sup> generation), Jacques Hadamard
				(5<sup>th</sup>), Sim&eacute;on Denis Poisson (9<sup>th</sup>), and
				Pierre-Simon Laplace (10<sup>th</sup>).</p>
