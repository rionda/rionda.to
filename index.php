					<p>I am an <strong>associate professor</strong> of <a
					href="https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/computer_science">computer
					science</a> at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu">Amherst
					College</a>, where I lead the <a
					href="https://acdmammoths.github.io">Data* Mammoths</a>, a
					research&amp;learning group of brilliant undergraduate students, and
					I serve as the founding director of the <a
					href="https://www.amherst.edu/about/science_at_amherst/data-science-initiative">Data
					Science Initiative</a>. I also have an appointment as visiting
					faculty in <a href="https://cs.brown.edu">Computer Science at Brown
					University</a>, where I advise PhD students. Previously, I spent
					some fantastic years as a research scientist in the Labs group at <a
					href="https://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>.</p>
					<p>My research focuses on <strong>algorithms</strong> for
					<strong>knowledge discovery</strong>, <strong>data mining</strong>,
					and <strong>machine learning</strong>. I develop theory and methods
					to extract the most information from large datasets, as fast as
					possible and in a statistically sound way. The problems I study
					include pattern extraction, graph mining, and time series analysis.
					My algorithms often use concepts from statistical learning theory and
					sampling. My research is supported, in part, by <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2238693&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF
					CAREER Award #2238693</a> and by <a
